# Fallout4 weapon-detect

******K-mean + photo Area measure can achieve this********


I use Fallout 4 video to weapon detect 's material  , and my motivation is want to make a Airport ' s weapon detect , this is my first idea , but I dont know how to get aorport video , so I simulate the airport 's conveyor belt , and put the unique fallout's weapon on the conveyor belt . After dealing with video's material , I use K-mean to achieve + 
photo Area to achieve this .
